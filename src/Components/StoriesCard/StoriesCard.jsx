                    <p>I visited the doctor a week back regarding my moms knee pain. She has osteoarthritis knee , consulted many orthopedic for this but could not get a satisfactory treatment. Then I consulted Dr.Amola. Her concept was very clear about the treatment options. Now I know what should be done for my mom's knee problem.We are very satisfied with the consultation, doctor was very good and calm, treated very nicely and given ample time and priority.
                        I would like to recommend him.</p>
